# PHP GIS Wrapper
Author: Karl Johann Schubert <karljohann@familieschubi.de>, Version: 0.2

The PHP GIS Wrapper is a PHP library to connect your PHP projects with AIESEC's Global Information System. It parses the swagger file (Normally: https://gis-api.aiesec.org/v1/docs.json) and thereby always provides you an up-to-date interface to the GIS.
